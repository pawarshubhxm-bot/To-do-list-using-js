# ✏️ To-Do List App

A simple, elegant, and fun **To-Do List** web app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps you plan your day, track tasks, and even roasts you (😂) if you try to add empty tasks!

## 💡 How It Works

1. Type a new task in the input field.  
2. Click the **Add** button or press **Enter** to add it to the list.  
3. Each task appears in a gray box with a small ❌ button to delete it.  
4. The app automatically updates the message below showing how many tasks remain.  
5. If you try adding an empty task, it will humorously roast you with a random alert! 🤣
